Switchover:


Step 1:- Check database role and database name

Primary database:-
SQL> 
select name,open_mode,database_role from v$database


Standby database:-
SQL> 
select name,open_mode,database_role from v$database


Precheck for Switchover:-

Step 2:-
SQL> 
ALTER SESSION SET nls_date_format=’DD-MON-YYYY HH24:MI:SS’;
SELECT sequence#, first_time, next_time, applied FROM v$archived_log ORDER BY sequence#;


Step 3:- 

SQL> 
select switchover_status from v$database;

==============================================================================================================================
Note: This command will give you appropriate message about the data guard current status.

The switchover_status column of v$database can have the following values:

Not Allowed:
        -Either this is a standby database and the primary database has not been switched first,
         or this is a primary database and there are no standby databases
Solution:         
         "alter database commit to switchover to physical standby with session shutdown", 

        
Session Active:
        - Indicates that there are active SQL sessions attached to the primary or 
        standby database that need to be disconnected before the switchover operation is permitted
        
Switchover Pending:
        - This is a standby database and the primary database switchover request has been received but not processed.
                
Switchover Latent:
        - The switchover was in pending mode, but did not complete and went back to the primary database
        
To Primary:
        - This is a standby database, with no active sessions, that is allowed to switch over to a primary database
        
To Standby:
        - This is a primary database, with no active sessions, that is allowed to switch over to a standby database
        
Recovery Needed:
        - This is a standby database that has not received the switchover request

On Primary database:-
************************
Step 4:-

SQL> 
alter database commit to switchover to standby;


Step 5:-

SQL> 
shutdown immediate

SQL> 
startup nomount

SQL> 
alter database mount standby database

Step 6:-

SQL> 
select name,open_mode,database_role from v$database;

SQL> 
alter database recover managed standby database disconnect from session;



On Standby database:
***********************************
Step 7:-

SQL> 
alter database commit to switchover to primary;

Step 8:-

SQL> 
select name,open_mode,database_role from v$database;
